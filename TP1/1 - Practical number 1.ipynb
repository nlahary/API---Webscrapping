    "\n",
    "APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, play a pivotal role in modern software development by facilitating communication and data exchange between different systems. They serve as bridges that allow applications to interact with each other seamlessly, enabling the creation of more robust and interconnected software.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs come in various forms, each serving specific purposes in the realm of software development. Let's explore some fundamental concepts:"

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "- **Question 1:** *Name three types of API protocols. Briefly explain the primary use of each.*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - REST: RESTful APIs are designed to be simple, scalable, and flexible. They are often used in web and mobile applications, as well as in Internet of Things (IoT) and microservices architectures. REST APIs are stateless, which means that each request contains all the necessary information to process it. REST APIs are resource-based, which means that each resource is identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and can be accessed using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. REST APIs are cacheable, which means that responses can be cached to improve performance and reduce network traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - GraphQL : GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that was developed by Facebook in 2012. GraphQL APIs have a single endpoint, which means that clients can fetch all the data they need from a single request. GraphQL APIs are declarative, which means that clients specify what they want, not how to get it. GraphQL APIs are schema-driven, which means that the schema defines the structure of the data and the available queries and mutations. GraphQL APIs are strongly typed, which means that each field has a specific data type. \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - SOAP : Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a messaging protocol used for exchanging structured data between different systems over the internet. SOAP is an XML-based protocol and is considered one of the earliest web service protocols. SOAP APIs were widely used in the early days of web services and are still used in several industries and sectors (Healthcare, Finance, Legacy systems..) today, although REST and GraphQL have become more popular in recent years. \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 2:** *What are the HTTP response code families? And what do they mean?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **1xx Informational:** These response codes indicate that the server has received the request and is processing it. They are used to inform the client that the server is still working on the request and that further action may be required. \n",
    "  - **2xx Success:** These response codes indicate that the request was successful and that the server was able to process it without any errors. The most common 2xx response code is 200 OK, which indicates that the request was successful. Other 2xx response codes include 201 Created, 204 No Content, and 206 Partial Content.\n",
    "  - **3xx Redirection:** These response codes indicate that the client must take additional action to complete the request. They are used to inform the client that the requested resource has been moved to a different location or that the client should use a different URI to access the resource.\n",
    "  -  **4xx Client Error:** These response codes indicate that there was an error in the request that prevented the server from processing it. The most common 4xx response code is 404 Not Found, which indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the server. Other 4xx response codes include 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, and 403 Forbidden.\n",
    "  -  **5xx Server Error:** These response codes indicate that there was an error on the server that prevented it from processing the request. The most common 5xx response code is 500 Internal Server Error, which indicates that there was an unexpected condition on the server that prevented it from fulfilling the request. Other 5xx response codes include 502 Bad Gateway, 503 Service Unavailable, and 504 Gateway Timeout.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Understanding these families helps developers diagnose and troubleshoot issues during API interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 3:** *What do the HTTP response codes 201, 401, and 404 mean?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **201:** : The 201 Created status code indicates that the request has been fulfilled and that a new resource has been created on the server. This response is typically returned after a successful POST request that creates a new resource.\n",
    "  - **401:** : The 401 Unauthorized status code indicates that the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response. This response is typically returned when the client sends a request without providing valid credentials or when the credentials provided are invalid\n",
    "  - **404:** : The 404 Not Found status code indicates that the server cannot find the requested resource. This response is typically returned when the client requests a resource that does not exist on the server or when the server cannot find the resource at the specified URI. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 4:** *Name the 4 basic HTTP verbs.*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - GET \n",
    "  - POST\n",
    "  - PUT\n",
    "  - DELETE\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 5:** *Explain the difference between PUT and PATCH?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **PUT:** : The PUT method is used to update an existing resource or create a new resource at a specific URI. When a client sends a PUT request to a server, it replaces the resource at the specified URI with the new representation provided in the request. If the resource does not exist, the server creates a new resource with the specified URI.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **PATCH:** : The PATCH method is used to update an existing resource with partial changes. When a client sends a PATCH request to a server, it provides a set of instructions that the server should apply to the existing resource to update it. The PATCH method is typically used when the client wants to update only a subset of the resource's fields or properties, rather than replacing the entire resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 6:** *Name at least two data formats commonly used in API exchanges.*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - XML (Extensible Markup Language)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 7:** *How can you verify the validity of a resource without getting the entire response?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  -  By using the HEAD method, which is similar to the GET method but only retrieves the headers of the response without the body. The HEAD method is useful for checking the validity of a resource, verifying the last-modified date, or checking the content type of the response without downloading the entire resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 8:** *What are the main concepts of REST? (name them)*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Resource:** In REST, resources are the key abstractions that clients interact with. Each resource is identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and can be accessed using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n",
    "  - **Representation:** In REST, resources are represented in different formats such as JSON, XML, or HTML. Clients can request different representations of a resource by specifying the appropriate content type in the request headers.\n",
    "  - **Stateless:** REST APIs are stateless, which means that each request contains all the necessary information to process it. The server does not store any client state between requests, and each request is independent of the others.\n",
    "  - **Uniform Interface:** REST APIs have a uniform interface that simplifies the interaction between clients and servers. The uniform interface consists of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes (200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found) that are used to communicate the state of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 9:** *Can you explain one of the main concepts of your choice from among those you mention? (Give an example if possible)*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - ** URI (Uniform Resource Identifier):** A URI is a string of characters that identifies a resource on the internet. URIs are used to locate and access resources such as web pages, images, videos, and APIs. URIs consist of two main components: the scheme (e.g., http, https) and the path (e.g., www.example.com/resource). For example, the URI `https://api.example.com/users/123` identifies the user with the ID 123 in the API hosted at `api.example.com`. Clients can use this URI to access the user's information by sending an HTTP request to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the subsequent sections, we will delve into practical exercises to apply and deepen our understanding of these concepts using SOAP, REST, and GraphQL APIs.\n"

    "# Exploring SOAP APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Few elements to remember about the SOAP Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The SOAP protocol, which means Simple Object Access Protocol, is one of the earliest web service protocols. SOAP is an XML-based protocol and was designed to provide a platform/language-independent way to exchange data between different systems over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **XML-Based Structure:** SOAP messages are structured using XML, making them both human-readable and machine-readable. This structure allows for the encapsulation of data and its transport between systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Platform and Language Independence:** One of the core objectives of SOAP is to provide a communication method that is independent of the underlying platform or programming language. This promotes interoperability between diverse systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Message Format:** SOAP messages consist of an envelope that defines the message structure and rules for processing, a set of encoding rules for data types, and conventions for representing remote procedure calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transport Neutrality:** SOAP can be used with various transport protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, and more. This flexibility in transport makes it adaptable to different network environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtain and display the capital of the Canada corresponding to the ISO code \"CA\" using the following SOAP API. \n",
    "Step by step guide :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1:** Examine the XML structure of the SOAP request provided. Identify the tag name that contains the ISO country code and the tag that will return the capital name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2:** Modify the existing SOAP request to use the ISO code \"CA\" isntead of \"FR\". Ensure that the XML structure remains correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 3:** Use the modified request to send a request to the SOAP services at the specified URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 4:** Analyze the response received. Extract and display the capital name from the SOAP response.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 5:** Remove sections of code that are not necessary to achieve this objective, in order to simply the script.\n",

    "### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercice you will retrieve the previous results in another way, by consuming the GraphQL API of SWAPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Few elements to remember about the GraphQL Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs that provides a more efficient and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs. In this exercise, we will interact with the Star Wars API (SWAPI) using GraphQL to retrieve specific information about characters, films, and species from the Star Wars universe. Some important aspects are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Endpoint:** GraphQL APIs typically have a single endpoint for all queries, making it more straightforward to manage and interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexible Responses:** Clients receive exactly the data they request, reducing over-fetching of data common in traditional REST APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Introspection:** GraphQL supports introspection, allowing clients to query the schema itself, making it self-documenting and aiding in development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in GraphQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GraphQL Schema:** GraphQL APIs have a schema that defines the types of data available and the relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Queries:** In GraphQL, clients specify the exact data they need using queries, allowing for more efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fields and Nested Structures:** Queries can include specific fields, and GraphQL supports nested structures to retrieve related data in a single request.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1: Introduction:** Understand the REST API Query. You can use the playground for this : https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/?query=%7B%0A%20%20allFilms%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20edges%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20node%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20id%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20title%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2: Retrieve Films with Character Information:** Retrieve Films with Character Information in a single query.\n",
